## Linked List Cycle


### Description

```Python
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

Follow up:
Can you solve it without using extra space?
```

### Solutions

#### Approach : Fast and Slow pointer

* Time complexity : O(n)
* Space complexity : O(1)

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def hasCycle(self, head):
        """
        Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

        Args:
            head(ListNode): the head node of the linklist
        
        Returns:
            a bool value: True or False
        """    
        slow = head
        fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if slow == fast:
                return True
        return False
