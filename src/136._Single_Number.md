## Single Number

### Description

```Python
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:

    Input: [2,2,1]
    Output: 1

Example 2:

    Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
    Output: 4
```

### Python Solutions

#### Approach 1: Dict(Hash Table)

* Time complexity : O(n)
* Space complexity : O(n)

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        """
        Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

        Args:
            nums(List[int]): the name of array of integers
        
        Returns:
            the number that only appears once in the array of integers
        """
        dic = {}
        for i in nums:
            if i in dic.keys():
                dic.pop(i)
            else:
                dic[i]=1
        return list(dic.keys())[0]
```

#### Approach 2: Bit operation

* Time complexity : O(n)
* Space complexity : O(1)

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        """
        Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

        Args:
            nums(List[int]): the name of array of integers
        
        Returns:
            the number that only appears once in the array of integers
        """
        res = nums[0]
        for i in nums[1:]:
            res ^= i
        return res
```
