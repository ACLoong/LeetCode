## Climbing Stairs

### Description

```Python
You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

Example 1:

    Input: 2
    Output: 2
    Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
    1. 1 step + 1 step
    2. 2 steps

Example 2:

    Input: 3
    Output: 3
    Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
    1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
    2. 1 step + 2 steps
    3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

### Python Solutions

#### Approach 1: Dynamic Programming

* Time complexity : O(n)
* Space complexity : O(n)

```Python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n):
        """
        You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

        Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

        Args:
            n(int): the number of steps of the stairs
        
        Returns:
            the total distinct methods of climbing the stairs from bottom to up
        """
        dp = range(n+1)
        dp[0] = 1
        dp[1] = 1
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
        return dp[n]
```

#### Approach 2: Fibonacci Number

* Time complexity : O(n)
* Space complexity : O(1)

```Python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n):
        """
        You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

        Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

        Args:
            n(int): the number of steps of the stairs
        
        Returns:
            the total distinct methods of climbing the stairs from bottom to up
        """
        if n <= 1:
            return 1
        pre = 1
        cur = 1
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            cur, pre = cur, pre + cur
        return cur
