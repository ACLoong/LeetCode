## Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

### Description

```Python
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:

    Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
    Output: 5
    Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
                 Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.

Example 2:

    Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

### Python Solutions

#### Approach : One Pass Iteration

* Time complexity : O(n)
* Space complexity : O(1)

```Python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

        Args:
            prices(List[int]): the name of array of integers
        
        Returns:

        for elem in prices:

            else:
                max_profit = max(max_profit, elem - min_price)
        
        return max_profit
