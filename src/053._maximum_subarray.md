## Maximum Subarray

### Description

```Python
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:
    Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
    Output: 6
    Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
```

### Python Solutions

#### Approach : Dynamic Programming

* Time complexity : O(n)
* Space complexity : O(1)

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def maxSubArray(self, nums):
        """
        Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum

        Args:
            nums(List[int]): the name of array of integers
        
        Returns:
            the largest contiguous subarray sum(int)
        """
        max_sum = nums[0]
        pre_max_sum = nums[0]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            prev_max_sum = nums[i] + max(prev_max_sum, 0)
	        max_sum = max(max_sum, prev_max_sum)
        return max_sum
