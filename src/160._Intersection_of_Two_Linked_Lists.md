## Intersection of Two Linked Lists

### Description

```Python
Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:
```

**Example 1:**

```Python
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3

Output: Reference of the node with value = 8

Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
```

**Example 2:**

```Python
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1

Output: Reference of the node with value = 2

Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
```

**Example 3:**

```Python
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2

Output: null

Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.

Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
```

**Notes:**

* If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
  
* The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.

* You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
  
* Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.


### Python Solutions

#### Approach : two pointers

* Time complexity : O(m+n)
* Space complexity : O(1)

```Python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA, headB):
        """

        Args:

        Returns:

        """
        if headA is None or headB is None:
