##  Majority Element

### Description

```Python
Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

Example 1:

    Input: [3,2,3]
    Output: 3

Example 2:

    Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
    Output: 2
```

### Python Solutions

#### Approach 1: Dict(Hash Table)

* Time complexity : O(n)
* Space complexity : O(n)

```Python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        """
        Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

        Args:
            nums(List[int]): the name of array of integers

        Returns: 
            the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times(int)
        """
        dic = {}
        for num in nums:
            if num not in dic:
                dic[num] = 1
            if dic[num] > len(nums)//2:
                return num
            else:
                dic[num] += 1 
```

#### Approach 2: Sorting

* Time complexity : O(nlogn)
* Space complexity : O(1)

```Python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        """
        Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

        Args:
            nums(List[int]): the name of array of integers

        Returns: 
            the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times(int)
        """
        nums.sort()
        return nums[len(nums)//2]
```
