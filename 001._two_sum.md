## Two Sum

### Description

```Python
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

### Solutions

#### Approach 1: Double loop

* Time complexity : O(n^2)
* Space complexity : O(1)

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

        Args:
            nums(List[int]): the name of array of integers
            target(int): the value that we assign
        
        Returns:
            the indices of the two numbers from the array
        """    
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return [i, j]

```

#### Approach 2: dict(Hash Table)

* Time complexity : O(n)
* Space complexity : O(n)

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

        Args:
            nums(List[int]): the name of array of integers
            target(int): the value that we assign
        
        Returns:
            the indices of the two numbers from the array
        """    
        lookup = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            if target - num in lookup:
                return [lookup[target-num], i]
            else:
                lookup[num] = i

```
